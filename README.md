# SEI Project 2

## Credit Management App

### Project : Easi Credit Management Application

### Concept

The concept of this application is that a user can have a single view of all their credit accounts, with the added advantage of being able to maintain them by either payment or settlement.

In order to use the system, a user has to register with their name and social security number - the social security number gets used as a reference key to aggregate all acounts. 

The application also has to report all arrear and default accounts to a credit agency, as soon as the account goes in arrears.
